## Installation
Anaconda distribution of Python should be just fine to run the code here (Python versions 3.*).

## Project Motivation
For this project, I am interested in exploring FIFA 23 players dataset to answer the following questions:
- how does Overall and Potential ratings look in general?
- where is players' potential for growth?
- how Growth is related to other players' attributes?
- how Growth looks in selected categories?
- can we model Growth using independent variables?
 
FIFA 23 data can be downloaded from Kaggle as .csv.

## File Descriptions
Notebooks available here are to showcase how Python can be leveraged in answering the above questions. 
Each notebook has comments and markdown cells that explain the thought process for individual steps.

## Results
The main findings and takeaways from the analysis of players' growth potential are presented at the post [here](https://medium.com/@adegajew/data-from-fifa-23-where-is-players-growth-potential-99cc988a1077).

## Acknowledgments
Must give credit to sofifa.com for the original data, clean data can be downloaded from Kaggle at the link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashncarry/fifa-23-complete-player-dataset?select=players_fifa23.csv) (the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information can also be found there).
